Negative Carbon by AXS: 13,5 MW Solar Power Project in Brazil
__________
The project Negative Carbon by AXS: 13,5 MW Solar Power Project in Brazil consists of several
project activities installed in Brazil, located in the state of Minas Gerais, at the villages São Gonçalo
do Sapucaí, Passos, Carmo Do Paranaíba, and Itatiaiuçu. The promoter of the project is AXS
ENERGIA S/A, a company which has the full ownership of the project activity.
____________
Having each power plant an installed capacity equal or under 5 MW, they are classified as minigeneration units under the electricity compensation system regulated by Brazil’s ANEEL (National
Electric Energy Agency), in accordance with normative resolutions n. 482/2012, n. 687/2015, and
federal law n. 14.300/2022. Under the electricity compensation system, the active energy injected by
a consumer unit with distributed mini-generation is transferred, through a free loan, to the local
distributor and then subsequently compensated with consumption offsetting.
By installing solar plants to offset the consumption of businesses, Project Owner is able to provide
them with energy from the Solar Plants within the energy compensation scheme: the generated

electricity is injected into the national grid, whereas customers receive credits that are offset in their
monthly energy bill. Therefore, the project activity has the purpose of contributing to the
transformation of the Brazilian energy matrix through the economic incentives of a clean, renewable,
and also cheaper energy source.


Emission reduction and impact of the project activity:
It is expected that the project activity displaces an estimated average of 30.482 MWh/year from the
combined generation of 6 small-scale power plants. Over the entire crediting period, project activity
will inject 35.171 MWh of renewable and clean energy into the Brazilian grid, mitigating the total
GHG emission reductions of 8.989,71 tCO2e. Project activity, thus, contributes to climate change
mitigation efforts.
